Solution of task: "Find first and last index of number in sorted array"

Input data

The first line of the input data contains two numbers N and M (1≤N,M≤200001≤N,M≤20000). The second line contains N non-decreasing ordered integers - elements of the first list. The third line contains M non-negative integers - elements of the second list. All numbers in the lists are 32-bit signed integers.

Output data

The program should output M lines. For each number from the second list we need to output the number of its first and last occurrences in the first list. The numbering starts from one. If the number is not included in the first list, you should print one number 0.
